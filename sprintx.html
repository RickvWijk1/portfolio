                <p>In this craft section you will learn how to make the Harry Potter effect 'Lumos'.</p>
                <h3>Supplies</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Computer with Premiere Pro 2015 version 9.0.0 or higher.
                        Here’s a link to download Premiere Pro. You can get it for free for 7 days.

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>A short video of you holding a stick or wand. If you are filming in the dark, make sure to have
                        a light switched on above you (out of camera range) so that it looks like the light is coming
                        from the wand instead.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Time: 30-60 minutes</li> <br>
                    <li>Patience</li><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <br>
                <p
                    style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">
                    <em><span style="font-size:19px;line-height:107%;">Set-up</span></em></p>
                <p>&emsp;1. Open Premier Pro
                    <br>
                    &emsp;2. Go to File > New > Project

                    <img src="assets/images/MakeNewProject.png" width="90%" height="90%"><br><br>
                    &emsp;3. In the New Project dialog box, name your project and click Browse to choose where you want
                    to save it.
                    <br>It’s best to leave the remaining settings as they are.
                    <br>Click OK when you’re done.<br>
                    <br>If everything went well, the Premiere Pro workspace should pop up.

                    <br><br>
                    Now we will import our video. This can be a video of you holding a wand, stick or pen.<br><br>
                    &emsp;4. Go to File &gt; Import<br><br>
                    Your File Explorer should pop up. From there, select the video of you holding a wand, stick or pen.
                    <img src="assets/images/FileExplorer.png" width="90%" height="90%"><br><br>
                    &emsp;5. Click OK when you’re done.<br><br>
                    You should be able to see the video you imported in the project window.
                    <br>If this window is not open for you, go to Window > Project or hold down Shift + 1 for Windows
                    and Mac.
                    <img src="assets/images/ProjectVideoWindow.png" width="90%" height="90%"><br><br>
                    Now that we have our video we are going to put it on our timeline.<br><br>
                    &emsp;6. Click on the video and drag it onto the timeline.<br>
                    If the timeline is not open for you, go to Window > Timelines or hold down Shift + 3 for Windows and
                    Mac.
                    <br>
                    <img src="assets/gif's/DragVidTimeline.gif" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
                    For our next step, we are going to cut the video in half. We want to cut the video in half exactly
                    on the frame
                    where we are about to lit the wand with a light.<br><br>
                    &emsp;7. Move to the frame described in the text above.
                    <br>&emsp;8. Cut the video in half. You can do so by hitting Ctrl + K on Windows and Cmd +
                    &emsp;K on Mac.
                    <br>
                    <img src="assets/gif's/CuttingVid.gif" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
                    Next up, we are going to add a lens flare effect.
                    Make sure you have the ‘Effects’ window open. <br>
                    <br>To open it go to Window > Effects or hold down Shift + 7 for Windows and Mac.<br>
                    <br>&emsp;9. Click in the search bar of the ‘Effects’ panel.
                    <br>&emsp;10. Type ‘Lens Flare’
                    <br>&emsp;11. Drag the Lens Flare effect onto your second clip.
                    <img src="assets/gif's/LensFlareDrop.gif" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
                    The Lens Flare will be visible on your screen if you have the blue timeline cursor set on the second
                    clip.

                    <img src="assets/images/TimeLineCursorOnClip.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
                    The Lens Flare will be presenting as the light on our wand so we need to place it on the very top of
                    the wand you are holding.
                    <br><br>In order to do that, take a look at the ‘Effect Controls’ window.
                    <br>To open it, go to Window > Effect Controls or hold down Shift + F5 for Windows and Mac.
                    <br><br>This is what you should see.
                    <img src="assets/images/Effect Controls.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
                    In this panel we can adjust the properties/attributes of the Lens Flare.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;12. Click on the small stopwatch icon of ‘Flare Brightness’, ‘Flare Center’ and ‘Blend With
                    Original’.
                    <br><br>The icons should turn blue.
                    <br>
                    &emsp;13. Up the percentage of ‘Blend With Original’ to around 60% to get a better view where you
                    are going to place the flare.
                    <br><br>
                    Firstly, we want the Lens Flare to be positioned correctly.
                    <br>&emsp;14. Select the Lens Flare effect in the ‘Effect Controls’ panel.
                    <br>&emsp;15. Now move the Lens Flare by dragging it inside the ‘Program’ panel.
                    <img src="assets/gif's/LensFlareDrag.gif" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
                    You can zoom in to be more precise with the positioning of the flare.
                    <img src="assets/gif's/ZoomInOption.gif" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
                    &emsp;16. We want the Lens Flare to increase in light intensity after we flicked the wand.
                    <br>In other words, when we flick with our wand like so:
                    <img src="assets/gif's/LumosWandFlick.gif" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>
                    <br>&emsp;17. Move about half a second forward in frames.
                    <br>&emsp;18. Increase the value of the ‘Flare Brightness’ to 100%.
                    <br><br>Now go back to the start of the second clip where you just flicked your wand.
                    <br><br>&emsp;19. From there, position the flare on top of the wand for every frame for the rest of
                    the clip until you are satisfied.
                    <br><br>The end result should look like this:
                    <br><img src="assets/gif's/Lumos.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

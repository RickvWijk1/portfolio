                                        <p>In my first week of the internship there was a standup
                                            meeting planned on Monday and Thursday. The
                                            schedule remained like this throughout the internship.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>In this week I setup a few things like writing a project
                                            plan,
                                            creating a scrum board
                                            for planning and reading up on the project so that I knew in
                                            what direction the project was headed and what stakeholders
                                            were involved. Furthermore, I thought about what kind of
                                            platform would be most suitable for the Design Challenge. I
                                            decided a website would be the best platform to provide
                                            stakeholders with info/data, because:
                                            <ul class="list">
                                                <li>Websites are very
                                                    accessible; websites can easily be shared through
                                                    links. A native app for example can't easily be
                                                    shared.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Websites can contain a lot of information; the
                                                    stakeholders will most likely be active on a desktop
                                                    screen which means there's a lot of space available
                                                    to provide information (in the right way). This is
                                                    useful since a lot of research output will have to
                                                    be provided. Apps made for mobile devices have a lot
                                                    less space to work with since mobile devices are
                                                    significantly smaller.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Websites are easy to maintain since there's a lot of
                                                    support (documentation, tools & communities)
                                                    available. Native or hybrid apps can be tricky to
                                                    maintain because of certain exclusive native
                                                    features and subscriptions.
                                                </li>

                                                Just like the MER project, Data Enabled
                                                Running is an innovative project run by
                                                a knowledge
                                                institution (TUE) within the field of
                                                Human Vitality. Their goal is to
                                                spread their research information. What's interesting is
                                                that their website is a one pager and they link their
                                                research to external websites. This might be because
                                                it's easier to spread their research by posting their
                                                research onto known research platforms.

                                                Alphabeats offers innovative software.
                                                They sell neurofeedback technology that
                                                reduces stress.

                                                lot of 'Call To Action' elements on their website. They
                                                are clearly trying to activate the user to engage with
                                                their products. On the home/landing page they clearly
                                                want to shift the user's attention to their products.

                                                students can upload their projects so
                                                that other can use these resources and
                                                can take inspiration from them. Their
                                                goal is dissemination of projects. What's interesting
                                                and possibly useful to the MER website is
                                                that they have a research card for each project that's
                                                posted on the website and that the user can filter them.

                                            background. I also noticed that most of the websites had a
                                            lot of different sections that were distinguishable by their
                                            difference in background colours. </p>

                                                plan</a>. The purpose of this project plan was to write
                                            down what the assignment entailed from my point of view so
                                            that I could get feedback from my internship supervisors in
                                            case my interpretation of the assignment wasn't exactly what
                                            they had in mind. It also helped me make a schedule by
                                            having to write down what the potential methods and products
                                            I was most likely going to use/produce during the internship
                                            and dividing these over the internship period.

                                        <p>An important aspect of the assignment is getting to know the
                                            stakeholders. For this reason I made a visualization where I
                                            mapped all the direct and indirect stakeholders. During this
                                            process I realized there were more parties involved than I
                                            initially thought. The information was mainly gathered
                                            through desktop research, but also by talking to Olaf en
                                            Bernd-Jan who of course knew some of the stakeholders
                                            already.
                                            After Olaf and Bernd-Jan gave me feedback
                                            on my first version of the chart I improved quite a few
                                            things.

                                                        decided to focus on what was relevant to the MER
                                                        project by lowering the opacity of less relevant

                                                    <p>In this final version I added another row that

                                                        Each project, including the MER project, has

                                                        research and put work into practice. Researchers
                                                        sometimes use research of others for their own

                                            From
                                            the very start the project members used jargon which made it
                                            more difficult for me to understand what the project
                                            entailed. For this reason I wrote down all the words I
                                            didn't fully understand and after looking up and asking what
                                            they meant I put the words and their definition in a table.
                                            I also added what the relation to the project was so that
                                            this glossary could potentially help new project members.

                                        <p>In my first week of the internship there was a standup
                                            meeting planned on Monday and Thursday. The
                                            schedule remained like this throughout the internship.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>In this week I setup a few things like writing a project
                                            plan,
                                            creating a scrum board
                                            for planning and reading up on the project so that I knew in
                                            what direction the project was headed and what stakeholders
                                            were involved. Furthermore, I thought about what kind of
                                            platform would be most suitable for the Design Challenge. I
                                            decided a website would be the best platform to provide
                                            stakeholders with info/data, because:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="list">
                                            <li>Websites are very
                                                accessible; websites can easily be shared through
                                                links. A native app for example can't easily be
                                                shared.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Websites can contain a lot of information; the
                                                stakeholders will most likely be active on a desktop
                                                screen which means there's a lot of space available
                                                to provide information (in the right way). This is
                                                useful since a lot of research output will have to
                                                be provided. Apps made for mobile devices have a lot
                                                less space to work with since mobile devices are
                                                significantly smaller.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Websites are easy to maintain since there's a lot of
                                                support (documentation, tools &amp; communities)
                                                available. Native or hybrid apps can be tricky to
                                                maintain because of certain exclusive native
                                                features and subscriptions.

                                                it's easier to spread their research by posting their

                                            background. I also noticed that most of the websites had a

                                            that I could get feedback from my internship supervisors in
                                            case my interpretation of the assignment wasn't exactly what
                                            they had in mind. It also helped me make a schedule by
                                            having to write down what the potential methods and products
                                            I was most likely going to use/produce during the internship
                                            and dividing these over the internship period.

                                        <p>An important aspect of the assignment is getting to know the
                                            stakeholders. For this reason I made a visualization where I
                                            mapped all the direct and indirect stakeholders. During this
                                            process I realized there were more parties involved than I
                                            initially thought. The information was mainly gathered
                                            through desktop research, but also by talking to Olaf en
                                            Bernd-Jan who of course knew some of the stakeholders
                                            already.
                                            After Olaf and Bernd-Jan gave me feedback
                                            on my first version of the chart I improved quite a few
                                            things.

                                        <p>I created a <a target="_blank"
                                                href="../assets/pdf/Begrippenlijst.pdf">glossary</a>.
                                            From
                                            the very start the project members used jargon which made it
                                            more difficult for me to understand what the project
                                            entailed. For this reason I wrote down all the words I
                                            didn't fully understand and after looking up and asking what
                                            they meant I put the words and their definition in a table.
                                            I also added what the relation to the project was so that
                                            this glossary could potentially help new project members.

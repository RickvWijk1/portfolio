                                                            and dividing these over the internship period.

                                                            already.

                                                            the very start the project members used jargon which made it
                                                            more difficult for me to understand what the project
                                                            entailed. For this reason I wrote down all the words I
                                                            didn't fully understand and after looking up and asking what
                                                            they meant I put the words and their definition in a table.
                                                            I also added what the relation to the project was so that
                                                            this glossary could potentially help new project members.

                                                After I had mapped out the stakeholders I was ready to speak to the
                                                stakeholders to

                                                out their goals and needs. It took a while to receive
                                                a response and plan meetings since most
                                                of
                                                the stakeholders had a tight schedule so in the meantime I decided to
                                                make
                                                the first designs of how the website should look like.

                                                            on

                                                            These are the first few designs I made before I was able
                                                            to
                                                            interview the stakeholders. The first couple of designs were
                                                            purely
                                                            created to get an idea of what information was going to
                                                            be
                                                            needed and what the hierarchy/layout of the website was
                                                            going to look like. This also helped me explain what I

                                                            Persona's tell you a lot more about a person's situation and

                                                            For this reason I decided to abandon the wireframing and

                                                            helped me create a solid foundation for the first few visual

                                                            discussed this with the project members and they agreed that
                                                            it would be good to have some sort of video and/or animation

                                                            workshop prototyping by making a video prototype first since
                                                            I would be able to show the project members what I had in

                                                            within the MER Project is decided it would be necessary to

                                                            The idea was to put these keywords in a looping text
                                                            animation. I made these animations in After Effects to show

                                                            was the outcome. The idea of this was to hold the background

                                                            planning to simply use plain/vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and
                                                            maybe add some libraries for small tasks like an email
                                                            system and lightboxes along the way since I was making a
                                                            simple informative website with minimal input from the
                                                            users. I set up a <a target="_blank"

                                                            foundation of the website, I asked the project members to
                                                            help fill in the content (e.g. research papers). To ensure
                                                            we wouldn't get any complicated merge conflicts we worked
                                                            together by using different branches. Each commit got a

                                                            be overkill for such a simple website. Frameworks can be
                                                            bulky which drags the website's performance down and can
                                                            overcomplicate things which can endanger maintainability. On
                                                            the other hand frameworks overall
                                                            reduce development time if they don't have too much of a
                                                            learning curve. I decided to search for a small framework
                                                            that could help me write the code quicker. This brought my
                                                            attention to TailwindCSS.</p>

                                                            so-called 'utility classes' available to use that are
                                                            basically shortened CSS properties that you can directly
                                                            insert as a class in your HTML elements. It's easy to learn
                                                            so for the project members it shouldn't be a problem to

                                                            don't necessarily need to use Tailwind's utilities. They can
                                                            also use vanilla CSS and overwrite Tailwind if necessary if
                                                            they prefer that.
